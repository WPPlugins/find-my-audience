The Find My Audience WordPress plugin is a blog promotion tool which searches Twitter for people and conversation who may be interested in your work

== Description ==

The Find My Audience WordPress plugin is a blog promotion tool which searches Twitter for people and conversations who may be interested in your work. When you authorize Twitter through the FMA plugin, you can post tweets directly to those potential readers and conversations, letting them know of your writings.  

Find My Audience is similar to the existing WordPress **Promote** plugin, with the crucial difference that it finds *new* potential readers, and is not limited to your existing friends and followers.  

= Usage =

After installing and activating the plugin, the **FMA Settings** Menu will appear in your WordPress Admin screen, and the Find My Audience Widget will appear in every post edit screen.  

1. From **FMA Settings**, Register for your free FMA account, or login if you already have an account. 
1. Next, sign in with your Twitter account. We will use your Twitter account to search for your audience, and you will be able to tweet at your discretion from within WordPress. 
1. The FMA Widget will now appear on every post edit screen.  Author and edit your post as you normally would in Wordpress, including assigning Categories and Tags to your post.  After saving your draft, the FMA widget will pre-populate with those items, which will be used as search terms on Twitter.  Feel free to remove any Categories or Tags that you do not feel are effective search terms, and to add more terms.  
 
Click the red Find My Audience button to initiate your search. We take your Categories and Tags and run them through our algorithm to find People and Conversations on Twitter that may be interested in your work.  

Potential audience are returned in tiles showing handles, key terms and our score of their relevance to you.  

You select People or Conversations, and sorting options with the drop-downs above the tiles.  

If a Person or Conversation looks promising to you, click the magnifying glass in the lower right of the tile to open a larger card. The card gives you even more detail about the Person or Conversation, and allows you to Follow a Person, or send a Tweet. Compose a Tweet that introduces yourself to a person or joins a conversation, and you may mention your blog post at the proper time, as etiquette dictates.  

You can also add a person or Conversation to **Leads** area, by highlighting the red reader icon below the score (on the tile) or next to the handle (on the card). You can access all your Leads as a group from the main **FMA Settings** menu (**My Leads**).
